O(VE^2)

algorithm EdmondsKarp
    input:
        graph   (graph[v] should be the list of edges coming out of vertex v in the
                 original graph and their corresponding constructed reverse edges
                 which are used for push-back flow.
                 Each edge should have a capacity, flow, source and sink as parameters,
                 as well as a pointer to the reverse edge.)
        s       (Source vertex)
        t       (Sink vertex)
    output:
        flow    (Value of maximum flow)

    flow := 0   (Initialize flow to zero)
    repeat
        (Run a bfs to find the shortest s-t path.
         We use 'pred' to store the edge taken to get to each vertex,
         so we can recover the path afterwards)
        q := queue()
        q.push(s)
        pred := array(graph.length)

                    pred[e.t] := e
                    q.push(e.t)

        if not (pred[t] = null)
            (We found an augmenting path.
             See how much flow we can send)
            df := infinity
            for (e := pred[t]; e != null; e := pred[e.s])
                df := min(df, e.cap - e.flow)

    until pred[t] = null  (i.e., until no augmenting path was found)
    return flow
